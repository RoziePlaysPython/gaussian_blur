# Gaussian blur
Here will be my gaussian blur implementation on python3 from scratch
__This readme will be improved after finishing main program__

Currently implemented:
- get scope from image by pixel
- - border solution is extending (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))
- apply weight to scope
